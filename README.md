#### Main files
[1- Mp3 to wav](utils/mp3_to_wav.command)
A bash script to split mp3 files into 4-second wav chunks. Remember to manually delete chunks shorter than 4 seconds.

[2- Spectrogram generator](spectrograms.ipynb)
A notebook to create the spectrograms from the wav chunks.

[3- Main file: latentbirds.ipynb](latentbirds.ipynb)
Jupyter notebook to train or test the generator. Execute the full notebook for training (1500 epochs, is going to take a while) or skip cell "Training" and load the precalculated weights.
